    Dew dew dewwww noise.
    "We'll find out after the break!" exclaims Chris to camera 2.
    "Awwww, you love doing that" you say over the podiums as a director calls cut.
    "Do I? Do I love that, do I? I love it, when I say that we will find something out after an ad break. I love that?
    You wait and process this uncharacteristic response from Chris Tarrant.
    Adverts run on a  moniter nearby.
    "Yeahhh." You say, without about as much conviction as a goat facing a tiger.
    Clanging behind you. There's somehing going on behind the scenes, but the house lights aren't up - which is odd on an ad break, but then...
    "OI! Tarrant!"
    It's only bloody Jeremy Clarkson, marching through swathes of black clad television crew. You look to Chris.
    "Oh shit" he says. He looks terrified.
    What the shit is this, Chris, you kfc bargain bucket of dicks!?"
    "Jeremy, just hold on..."
    A producer tries to stand directly in his path to their wonderboy Tarrant."
    Well we know how well that went down on Top Gear.
    Jeremy lands a devestating right hook on the jaw of the producer, who sprawls across the studio floor.
    "Keep them coming, ITV, I came just came to eat meat and punch producers, and I am allll out of meat!"
    This, rather terrifying interlude has you questioning whether you really ought to just get up out of the chair, and let these two titans of the small screen hash it out.
    "But before you can, Chris grabs your arm."
    "Be cool," Chris hisses "There's a shiv taped to the bottom of your stool, when I give the signal, put it in my hand."
    He moves away, toward the oncoming Clarkson, all fury and thinly-veiled neo conservative imperialism.
    What fucking signal though, you think as you search desperately for this... shiv?! Why is there a shiv taped to the stool!
    You find it, and yank it from it/'s duct tape hold.
    "Jeremy, cool down, let/'s chat." Tarrant has his soothing voice on.
    You notice Chris/'s right hand has drifted behind him his palm open facing towards you. Is this the signal?
    Clarkson is swinging away at runners, producers and directors like a Silverback, batting away a family of mongooses."
    The entire studio floor is littered with bloody and unconscious television crew.
    "Tarraaaannnnnnnt!" Shouts Jeremy.
    "You glance back to Chris' hand and see he is opening and closing it, grabbing behind him at thin air - That has to be the signal!
    "You jummp up and with the skill of a relay race runner palm off the crude shiv - a blade strapped to a hollow microphone - into Tarrant's hand!
    The gap between the two hosts has closed considerably and just as Clakson is winding up to strike, Chris fires the blade into his gut.
    Blood spills out of the giant racist with each sharp intrusion Chris makes.
    "AARRgh, noooo, not like thiiiiiisss."
    Jeremy is dying. Chris walks backwards away from him and drops the blade.
    From the wings, in swoops James May and Richard Hammond. Hammond is weeping. May seems to have wet himself.
    "Bezos will have your head for this Tarrant" Richard Hammond wails!
    Tarrant seems unfazed as even more TV crew pulls the dead and unconscious away.
    May and Hammond carry off Clarkson/'s bloody corpse down the very tunnel from where you entered into this Lovecraftian nightmare.
    A sharp sound draws your attention to the monitor displaying the adverts.
    A Public Service Annoucment is being broadcast by Amazon, across all channels, and all devices. Everywhere.
    Jeff Bezos appears on screen. His cyborg arms spin in fury.
    Calling all contractors. The price on the head of Chris Tarrant has now risen to $14,000,000."
    "I AM BEZOS. AND I HAVE SPOKEN."
    You look to Chris, who is unconvincingly shrugging.
    "30 seconds until we're back!" You hear from behind you.
    "I thought this wasn't live!?" you say.
    Chris looks back at you, now covered in Clarkson blood, he looks like Nosferatu.
    Some of it is, some isn/'t - no-one really knows. Not really."
    As you sit blankly considering the events that have unfolded, you wonder if you are actually in a coma, and if, like you hope, you/'ll be woken by friends and family before too long.""")
