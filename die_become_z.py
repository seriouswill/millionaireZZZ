        Chris sucks air in through his unnaturally pearly teeth.
    The audience are baying for blood.
    You look deep into Tarrants eyes and see... joy?
    You said --letter--- that is the... WRONG answer!!"
    His face lights up.
    From behind you, you hear the sharp creak of metal unhinging, and a viscious crackling as the bars holding the now frenzied mob come down.
    Your locked gaze starts to rise, following Chris's eyes up as his stool begins to rise, raising him up and up into the studio rafters where he immediately met by more show runners who shroud him in robes and drinks.
    "BLLEEEUAGHHH!!!!"
    You look back down, house lights up, and to your horror, as they begin to approach you, you see the audience are in fact...
    THE UNDEAD.
    "Oh fuck."
    You glance around - all exits full of the snarling and braying undead.
    "Oh fuuuuuckkkk!""
    Limbless corpses surround you. There is no escape."
    "Chris! Chris, help, help me please for fuck's sake!" you yell!
    You look up and see Chris has a vantage point over the entire proceedings. He has a cigar on the go. 
    "Wanker.
    "As they hoard begin to supplant every inch of space around you, you aim the entirety of your lifes anger skyward and scream.
    ""Chris Tarrant You WANKERRRRRRR!"
    You died. But...
    As though time at has passed you begin to grunt and bleeeuugh.
    A tazer wielding show runner approaches you.
    You grunt more heartily now you see their pulsing, delicious neck. God, you're hungry did you not have a snack in the Green Room?
    "STICK HIM WITH THE OTHERS THEN", you hear pumped out over the tannoy.
    "Grubnt, Blueghs, GRUNTHY GRUNCH." you say.
    You didn't mean to say that, but that's what came out. what's happening? All you can think about is lashing out and biting at the show runner who is herding you into the audience cage.
    "BLAH!" You think to yourself. "Blat must be it. I'm a zombie."
    And you'd be right. You are the recently reanimated corpse of your former self.
    But look on the bright side, you dumbly think as you watch a fresh faced new contestent be ushered onto the stool ahead of you...
    "They look tasty."
    Start again?
